# ngrx-auth-example

This is a simple application showing how to use ngrx and OAuth. Pretty much work in progress.


### Quick start

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:SekibOmazic/ngrx-auth-example.git

# change directory to our repo
cd ngrx-auth-example

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# start the server
npm start
```
go to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) in your browser


## Issues

- Figure how to pass the jwt token into ApiService (`/ngrx/users` not protected yet)
- Changing URL in browser breaks the application
